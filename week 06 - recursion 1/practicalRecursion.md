# Department of Computing, Macquarie University

## Practical class - Recursion

# NOTE

We will continue working with the `COMP1010_source_codes_for_students` project. This week, we are dealing with package `practicalClassCodes.week06`.

## Outline

- 5 to 30 minutes: Call stack and stack frames in a recursive design
- 31 to 60 minutes: demos
	- numeric-based examples
	- String-based examples
- 61 minutes to end of class: 
	- practice,
	- practice, and, 
	- more practice

## ACTIVITY 1 - Call stack and stack frames

Trace the function calls and the status of call stack for the following codes:

```java
public class Recursion_6_1 {
	public static int mystery(int a, int b) {
   		if(b == 0) {
			return a;
		}
		return mystery(b, a%b);
	}
	
	public static boolean 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x = 16, y = 44;
		int z = mystery(x, y);
		System.out.println(z);
	}
}
```

```java
public class Recursion_6_2 {
	public static int steep(String a) {
   		if(a == null || a.isEmpty()) {
			return 0;
		}
		if(a.charAt(0) == ' ') {
			return 1 + steep(a.substring(1));
		}
		return steep(a.substring(1));
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String s = "is it on?";
		int b = steep(s);
		System.out.println(b);
	}
}
```

```java
//ADVANCED (take-home)
public class Recursion_6_3 {
	public static String funky(String a, String b) {
   		if(a == null || b == null || a.length() < b.length()) {
			return a;
		}
		String first = a.substring(0, b.length());
		if(first.equals(b)) {
			return funky(a.substring(b.length()), b);
		}
		return a.charAt(0) + funky(a.substring(1), b);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String s1 = "inkling";
		String s2 = "in";
		String s3 = funky(s1, s2);
		System.out.println(s3);
	}
}
```
	
## IMPORTANT

Students should pair-up for the rest of this workshop. For all programs, you should design the solution (not the code!) together, then person A should code and person B should act as an observer. If the observer sees a mistake, they may interject.

## ACTIVITY 2 - Demo of recursive design and coding

In the first task, your tutor will design and implement a recursive solution for,

1. [Number-based problem](https://codingbat.com/prob/p163932) 
2. [String-based problem](https://codingbat.com/prob/p170371)

## ACTIVITY 3 - Practising in pairs

Practice questions sequentially from [https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1)

The order is:

1. `factorial` (hint available, use only if needed)
2. `bunnyEars` (hint available, use only if needed)
3. `fibonacci`
4. `bunnyEars2`
5. `triangle`
6. `sumDigits`
7. `count7`
8. and so on...

## Week 6 submission

- You should be working with package `practicePackage.recursion`, stages 1 and 2 only. 
- There are a total of 21 functions across the two stages. 
- You should implement all solutions recursively. 
- IMPORTANT!!! Any use of loop automatically disqualifies your submission.
- Your code should pass **AT LEAST 10 functions to pass the hurdle**. 
- Each function is worth 5 marks. Solving 20 functions will get you a full mark for week 6. 
- Solving the 21st function will earn you my respect but unfortunately no bonus marks.

Drag and Drop the two java files (Stage1.java, Stage2.java) from the package explorer into "Week 6 submission" submission box by **Sunday 4th April, 21:00**.
Any compilation error, StackOverflowError or any infinite loop in ANY of the files will result in an automatic zero.

## ADVANCED PRACTICE QUESTIONS

If you are done with Recursion - 1, move on to [https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2).

## ADVANCED QUESTIONS

**This is for students looking for something fairly challenging.**
Solve as many questions as you can from [RecursionService.java] in `practiceClassCodes.week06.RecursionService`
