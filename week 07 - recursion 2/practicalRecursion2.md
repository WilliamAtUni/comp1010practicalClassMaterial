## Practical - Recursion (2)

# Activity 1

Your tutor will take questions about recursion and guide you accordingly. 
They may take some time to go over basic concepts and help you with ways of coming up with recursive design.

# Activity 2

This week we will be working purely on codingbat exercises:

- [Recursion 1](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1), and only after you finish all of these,
- [Recursion 2](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2)

Make sure you create an account and login before working on these exercises, otherwise your work will not be saved on the website.

For those who have already done all the exercises (which I doubt), you can *tail-optimize* as many as possible.

This is a chance for you to seek help from your tutors if you have trouble understanding recursion.

We will utilise *breakout rooms* for pair-programming where you are free to choose your partner. If there are an odd number of students, tutor will assign the last student left to a group.

Tutor will stay in the main channel and assist anyone who needs extra help, and will duck in and out of different breakout rooms to see if you need any guidance.

# Submission Task

### Due: 5pm (17:00:00) Sunday 24th April Sydney Time

You should be working with Stages 2, 3 and 4 of package `practicePackage.recursion.attempts`. If you solved some functions from Stage 2 for week 6 submission, excellent, you can re-use the same! Tail-optimise your code to gain better understanding (even though Java doesn't facilitate it yet).

Each function is worth 5 marks. To clear the hurdle for week 7, you must pass tests for,

- **at least** 6 functions from Stage2, and, 
- **at least** 4 functions collectively from Stages 3 and 4. You can have all 4 from a single stage or a mix.

Drag and drop the three files by **5pm (17:00:00) Sunday 24th April Sydney Time**.

- Standard rules listed on iLearn apply.
- You should implement all solutions purely recursively (absolutely no iteration or simply delegating to built-in methods like `Math.pow` - you get a zero if that happens). 
- no loops + function must meaningfully call itself or its helper(s) must call themselves - directly or indirectly - to achieve the solution. If any of your function has loops or does not call itself - directly or indirectly, your submission will be disqualified and you will fail this hurdle.
- Time limit: 5 seconds.
- Marks will be capped at 100.
- Helper functions are allowed.
- Any method operating on `String` objects is allowed.
- `Math.max`, `Math.min`, `Math.abs` are allowed. `Math.pow` is not.
- If you call functions from Stage1, make sure you submit it as well, otherwise compilation errors will cause problems and standard rules about the same kick in.
- IMPORTANT!!! Any use of any loop automatically disqualifies your submission.
- Any compilation error and/or any `StackOverflowError` disqualifies your submission.
