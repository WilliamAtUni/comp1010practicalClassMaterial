## Workshop - Recursion (2)

# NOTE

This week we will be working purely on codingbat exercises:

- [Recursion 1](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1), and only after you finish all of these,
- [Recursion 2](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2)

Make sure you create an account and login before working on these exercises, otherwise your work will not be saved on the website.

For those who have already done all the exercises (which I doubt), you can *tail-optimize* as many as possible.

This is a chance for you to seek help from your tutors if you have trouble understanding recursion.

We will utilise *breakout rooms* for pair-programming where you are free to choose your partner. If there are an odd number of students, tutor will assign the last student left to a group.

Tutor will stay in the main channel and assist anyone who needs extra help, and will duck in and out of different breakout rooms to see if you need any guidance.

## Week 7 submission

You should be working with Stages 2, 3 and 4 of package `practicePackage.recursion.attempts`. If you solved some functions from Stage 2 for week 6 submission, excellent, you can re-use the same! Tail-optimize your code to gain better understanding (even though Java doesn't facilitate it yet).

Each function is worth 5 marks. To clear the hurdle for week 7, you must pass tests for,

- **at least** 6 functions from Stage2, and, 
- **at least** 4 functions collectively from Stages 3 and 4. You can have all 4 from a single stage or a mix.

Drag and drop the three files by **Sunday 12th September, 21:00**.

- Standard [rules](https://ilearn.mq.edu.au/mod/page/view.php?id=6701867) apply.
- You should implement all solutions purely recursively (absolutely no iteration or simply delegating to built-in methods like `Math.pow` - you get a zero if that happens). 
- Time limit: 5 seconds.
- Helper functions are allowed.
- Any method operating on String objects is allowed.
- IMPORTANT!!! Any use of any loop automatically disqualifies your submission.
- Any compilation error and/or any StackOverflowError disqualifies your submission.
